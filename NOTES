- pitch slide is fucked, needs a redesign and rewrite
- make it clearer when in visual replace pseudo-mode
	- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost
- fix envelope properly (properly de-click, remove retrigger artifacts, need some state)
	- use hold time to normalize notes a bit instead of emulating analogue timing intricacies
- use set_pixel_unsafe
- dynamically set WAVEFORM_LAZY_BLOCK_SIZE
- some waveshapers are always too loud when affecting quiet samples
	- remove signed unsigned conversion?
- show instruments without parent notes, for MIDI CCs
	- allow changing instruments during a sound? (naive approach breaks midi)
- instrument midi channel value sometimes jumps really high, idk why
	- either some weird memory corruption or i'm big dumb

- portamento to note off should act like a tape stop
	- portamento to C-0, then off
- visual mode cycle should cycle the selection
- waveform visual bug when opening files
	- honestly just force to the pattern tab on load lol

- sample gain
	- LOT of range, esp. upwards (~10x or so)
	- show gain on the waveform view?
	- gain/pan: [80][80]

lookback:
	- bpm macros
	- portamento masks(?) the starting note
