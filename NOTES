- change the cursor shape to help differentiate modes
- Ixy isn't always smoothed properly over trigs, should be fixed by Gxx-like slew

- rx0 reaching the beginning of the sample cuts the note

lookback needs proper testing, some macros are probably inexplicably broken
for no apparent reason
	- lookback resets the envelope, cutting long attacks immediately
		- not sure the solution to this design-wise
	- bpm macros are really fucked, lookback reads macros it shouldn't be able to see


- multithreading is currently broken
- loop ramping should use data from outside the loop range instead of padding the range
the first time a channel plays a sound it's much clickier than it is every later time
	- probably due to the envelope?


addVariant->_copyVariant->malloc memory leak



octave setting is kinda awful
	- remove the global octave? or at least separate binds to change the global octave
	  and binds to change the selected note's octave
	- bind to set the octave of the hovered note and NOT the default octave?
		- maybe inc/dec by octaves? ctrl+alt+a/x or smth
only apply step when holding alt?
the instrument index modes need to be rethought
mode where keyboard shortcuts toggle mute channels, with a popup that links keys with channels
	- shift+key to solo
	- dynamic mapping, map to the home row first?
resident tooltip popup, togglable with '?'
multi-channel copy/paste is currently broken, fix it
	- include variants as well
reduce the distinction between vtrig columns and variant content columns
add variant macro columns
	- default to 1 variant macro column
		- use the same mutation keybinds as row macros use
	- different scope to row macro columns
	macros:
		- +x: local transpose up     } linked   }
		- -x: local transpose down   } "        } preview these while editing
		- /x: local speed up     } linked       }
		- *x: local speed down   } "            }
		- Gx: global mono gain scale
		- Fx: global mono filter cutoff scale
		- Zx: global mono filter resonance scale
		- ?x: instrument offset (unsigned)


LADSPA effects:
- handle odd audio port arrangements gracefully
	- mono handling
	- ignore everything after the first 2 ports
	- handle 0 ports as well as possible
- process code
- ensure copy/paste works as expected

ladspa bugs:
- some controls don't respect limits
	- think it's probably a logarithmic control issue, might not be
- the stereo field is fucked
- segfaults cos effects aren't atomic yet
