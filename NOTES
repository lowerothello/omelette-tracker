- waveform amplify/normalize

- pitch slide is fucked
	- it seems ok sometimes? idk
- preview mode gets in the way a lot more than it should
- most waveshapers should probably be more aggressive at their limit
- tracker undo buffer
- make it clearer when in visual replace pseudo-mode
	- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost

- replace default gain with sample gain, default gain should always be G88
	- LOT of range, esp. upwards (20x or so)
	- remove hard clip waveshaper?
	- stereo gain: +[80][80]
	- gain/pan: +[80][80]
	- phase inversion sign bit

- try to ramp only once per preprocessRow() call

midi:
	- extraneous midi note offs on the first play after startup
		- one for each tracker channel, all on midi channel 0(variable?)
	- orphaned notes on quit because notes aren't properly stopped

lookback:
	- bpm macros
	- pitch slides mask(?) the starting note
