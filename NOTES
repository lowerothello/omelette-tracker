- change the cursor shape to help differentiate modes
	- especially for replace modes
- Ixy isn't always smoothed properly over trigs, should be fixed by Gxx-like slew

- rx0 reaching the beginning of the sample cuts the note
	- should hold the pointer at 0

lookback
- lookback resets the envelope, cutting long attacks immediately
	- not sure the solution to this design-wise
- bpm macros are really fucked, lookback reads macros it shouldn't be able to see


- multithreading is currently (slightly) broken
	- threads fail to initialize randomly, not sure why (idk pthreads very well)
		- they also print to stderr when they fail (think this is caused by the jack wrapper)
- the first time a channel plays a granular instrument it's much clickier than it is every later time
	- granular algorithm bug, not present for simple instruments (didn't test wavetable)
	- exaggerated by O00 calls (not fully eliminated by using pitchedpointer as the time base)


- don't like the global octave setting binds (number keys)
- mode where keyboard shortcuts toggle mute channels, with a popup that links keys with channels
	- shift+key to solo
	- dynamic mapping, map to the home row first?
- resident tooltip popup, togglable with '?'
	- requires a huge rewrite to how input is handled

binds to jump to the current channel's vtrig/note/inst/nth macro
	- polyend inspired
	- toggle vtrig/note/inst/macro visibility
	- toggle column visual line inclusion?

- lv2 atom ports
- lv2 scale points
