- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost
	- change the cursor shape to help
- use set_pixel_unsafe
- dynamically set WAVEFORM_LAZY_BLOCK_SIZE?
	- how?
- instrument midi channel value sometimes jumps really high, idk why
	- either some weird memory corruption or i'm big dumb (probably the latter)
- waveform visual bug when opening files
- clear the bottom line and leave the cursor at the beginning of it when quitting
- smooth midi cc loses track of the correct old cc value when midiccindex is changed
	- need to remember state for all midi ccs?
	- might cut smooth midi cc from scope
- ramping causes clicks, think it's from the filter? not sure
- tracker binds when the pattern is null are too restrictive, only tab is allowed
- tracker binds are organised really REALLY badly in the code, they're really awkward to maintain
- pattern history doesn't save channelc properly, causing zombie channels
	- don't save channelc, don't let undo/redo manipulate the channel index

- bind to set the octave of the hovered note and NOT the default octave?
	- maybe inc/dec by octaves? ctrl+shft+a/x or smth
- portamento to note off should act like a tape stop
- rx0 reaching the beginning of the sample cuts the note
- Qxx can swap to qxx but not the other way round

lookback needs testing, some macros are probably inexplicably broken for no apparent reason
