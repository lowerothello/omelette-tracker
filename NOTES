- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost
	- change the cursor shape to help
- waveform visual bug when opening files
- clear the bottom line and leave the cursor at the beginning of it when
  quitting
- smooth midi cc loses track of the correct old cc value when midiccindex is
  changed
	- need to remember state for all midi ccs?
	- might cut smooth midi cc from scope
- Ixy isn't always smoothed properly over trigs
	- should be fixed by Gxx-like slew

- bind to set the octave of the hovered note and NOT the default octave?
	- maybe inc/dec by octaves? ctrl+alt+a/x or smth
- portamento to note off should act like a tape stop
- rx0 reaching the beginning of the sample cuts the note
- Qxx can swap to qxx but not the other way round

lookback needs proper testing, some macros are probably inexplicably broken
for no apparent reason
	- also lookback performs too badly
