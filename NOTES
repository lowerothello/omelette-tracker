- waveform amplify/normalize

- pitch slide is fucked
	- it seems ok sometimes? idk
- preview mode gets in the way a lot more than it should
- most waveshapers should probably be more aggressive at their limit
- tracker undo buffer
- make it clearer when in visual replace pseudo-mode
	- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost

- changing tabs retriggers the pattern
- navigation fucks with the focused channel's audio

midi:
	- extraneous midi note offs on the first play after startup
		- one for each tracker channel, all on midi channel 0(variable?)
	- orphaned notes on quit because notes aren't properly stopped

lookback:
	- bpm macros
	- pitch slides mask(?) the starting note
