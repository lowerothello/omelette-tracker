- change the cursor shape to help differentiate modes
- waveform visual bug when opening files
- clear the bottom line and leave the cursor at the beginning of it when
  quitting
- Ixy isn't always smoothed properly over trigs, should be fixed by Gxx-like slew

- rx0 reaching the beginning of the sample cuts the note
- Qxx can swap to qxx but not the other way round
- Oxx gets fucked by notestretch

- bind to set the octave of the hovered note and NOT the default octave?
	- maybe inc/dec by octaves? ctrl+alt+a/x or smth

lookback needs proper testing, some macros are probably inexplicably broken
for no apparent reason
	- also lookback performs too badly, should be multithreaded


- multithreading is currently broken
- loop ramping should use data from outside the loop range instead of padding
