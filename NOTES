- pitch slide is fucked
	- it seems ok sometimes? not sure
- tracker undo buffer
- make it clearer when in visual replace pseudo-mode
	- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost
- tilde in tracker visual (replace) mode
- fix envelope properly (properly de-click, remove retrigger artifacts, probably need state)
	- use hold time to normalize notes a bit instead of emulating analogue timing intricacies
- consider re-adding instrument index preview mode
- gain slide doesn't seem to work

- sample gain
	- LOT of range, esp. upwards (20x or so, otherwise quiet samples are unusable)
	- show gain on the waveform view?
	- gain/pan: [+80][80]
	- phase inversion sign bit

midi:
	- extra midi note offs on the first play after startup
		- one for each tracker channel, all on midi channel 0(variable?)
	- orphaned notes on quit because notes aren't properly stopped

lookback:
	- bpm macros
	- pitch slides mask(?) the starting note
