- pitch slide is fucked
	- it seems ok sometimes? not sure
- make it clearer when in visual replace pseudo-mode
	- make modes clearer in general, it's too easy to get lost
- fix envelope properly (properly de-click, remove retrigger artifacts, need some state)
	- use hold time to normalize notes a bit instead of emulating analogue timing intricacies
- ctrl+click to set step also sets the channel, looks tricky to restrict
- use set_pixel_unsafe
- dynamically set WAVEFORM_LAZY_BLOCK_SIZE
- remove reliance on oldmode
- some waveshapers are always too loud when affecting quiet samples
	- remove signed unsigned conversion?
- show instruments without parent notes, for MIDI CCs
- instrument midi channel sometimes jumps really high, idk why

- portamento to note off should act like a tape stop
- visual mode cycle should cycle the selection
- waveform visual bug when opening files
	- honestly just force to the pattern tab on load lol

- sample gain
	- LOT of range, esp. upwards (~10x or so)
	- show gain on the waveform view?
	- gain/pan: [80][80]

lookback:
	- bpm macros
	- pitch slides mask(?) the starting note
