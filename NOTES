- Ixy isn't always smoothed properly over trigs, should be fixed by Gxx-like slew

- yy should respect the vtrig column

lookback
- lookback resets the envelope, cutting long attacks immediately
	- not sure the solution to this design-wise
- bpm macros are really fucked, lookback reads macros it shouldn't be able to see

- don't like the global octave setting binds (number keys)

- lv2 atom ports
- lv2 scale points

- i don't like how hardcoded the send is
	- arbitrary buses?
	- no other ideas lol
