| MACRO REFERENCE |
'-----------------'

All the macros that are supported by omelette, and their semantics. Some macros
are heavily inspired by other trackers, some are wholly original.
	- Listed in alphabetical order.
	- All arguments are in hexadecimal (base 16).
	- Case is inverted, to input a lowercase macro hold shift.


Bxx - BPM
	set the bpm of the song to xx, values between 32 and 255 are allowed

Cxy - FRACTIONAL NOTE CUT
	send a note off x/y through the row

Dxy - FRACTIONAL NOTE DELAY
	wait until x/y through the row to trigger the note
	only has any effect if a note is specified
	useful for triplets and similar sub-row timing

dxx - FINE NOTE DELAY
	wait until xx/255 through the row to trigger the note
	only has any effect if a note is specified
	useful for precise delays and sequencer abuse, eg:
		- comb filtering with a duplicate channel
		- flanging, when combined with Vxy and a duplicate channel

Gxy - STEREO GAIN
	set the gain of the left channel to x/15
	set the gain of the right channel to y/15
	reset back to the instrument gain on each new note

gxy - SMOOTH STEREO GAIN
	slide the gain of the left channel to x/15 over the row
	slide the gain of the right channel to y/15 over the row
	reset back to the instrument gain on each new note

Pxx - PITCH SLIDE
	portamento to the note specified at speed xx
	low xx values are slower

Rxy - BLOCK RETRIGGER
	retrigger y times over a block of size x rows
	overridden by another Rxy macro if the block hasn't finished
	won't restart the sample, \
		will continue as if nothing happened at the end of the block

txy - GATE
	gate the signal aggressively, more of an effect than a noise gate
	x is the strength of the effect (max reduction and speed)
	y is the threshold

Vxy - VIBRATO
	modulate the pitch of the sample at speed x and depth y
	lfo is hardcoded to a triangle wave
	modulation goes both up and down
	will NOT be overridden, \
		will only read another Vxy macro only if the lfo has ended

WAVESHAPERS (Wxy)
W0x - HARD CLIPPER
	clips off the tips of the signal
	x is the input gain
W1x - SOFT CLIPPER (smoothly add odd harmonics)
	rounds off the tips of the signal
	x is the input gain
W2x - RECTIFIER (aggressively add even harmonics)
	full-wave rectifies the signal
	full mix will not play the fundamental since that is an odd harmonic
	x is the mix
W3x - RECTIFIERx2 (poor man's octaver)
	full-wave rectifies the signal twice
	full mix will not play the fundamental since that is an odd harmonic
	x is the mix
W4x - WAVEFOLDER
	folds over the tips of the signal
	x is the input gain
W5x - WAVEWRAPPER
	wraps the signal back to 0 when it crosses 1
	x is the input gain
W6x - SIGN CONVERSION
	simulates reading an unsigned number as a signed number
	adds a nasty DC offset, be careful!
	x is the mix
