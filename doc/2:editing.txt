MODES
=====
Omelette is a model editor with vi-like binds. This section is a comprehensive
list of most actions as a reference.

all modes
---------
"Esc." pulls the mode a step towards normal mode. usually this goes straight to
       normal mode but there are a couple exceptions to this.
"Tab" toggles between the pattern editor and the song playlist.

most non-insert modes
---------------------
"1"/"2"/"3"/"4"/"5"/"6"/"7"/"8"/"9"/"0" sets the vi-like count, most macros
                                        react to this.
"h"/"Left"  moves the cursor one cell to the left.
"j"/"Down"  moves the cursor one cell down.
"k"/"Up"    moves the cursor one cell up.
"l"/"Right" moves the cursor one cell to the right.
"f" toggles song follow (the cursor will follow the song as it plays).
"b" sets the song bpm to the count.
"s" sets the edit step to the count.
"t" sets the row highlight to the count.
"o" sets the edit octave to the count.
"gg"/"Home" moves the cursor to the top.
"G"/"End"   moves the cursor to the bottom.
"Ctrl+a" increments the current cell.
"Ctrl+x" decrements the current cell.

"K?" sets the k-mode to the macro ?. (TODO: document k-modes, they're convoluted)

** ALL "r*" BINDS ALSO REACT TO "R*", "R*" APPLYS TO ALL CHANNELS **
"rc" sets the channel to stop at the cursor.
"rr" sets the channel to full length, or the count.
"ra" increases the length of the channel.
"rd" reduces the length of the channel.
"r+" doubles the length of the channel by duplicating it down.
"r-" halves the length of the channel by discarding the lower half.
"r*" doubles the length of the channel by inserting blank rows after every row.
"r/" halves the length of the channel by discarding every other row.

song mode
---------
"{"/"Ctrl+Up"   cycles the part of the playlist below the cursor up.
"}"/"Ctrl+Down" cycles the part of the playlist below the cursor down.
"v" enter visual mode.
"?" toggles this index to loop.
">" queues this index to play next.
"a" sets the current index to an empty index.
"J" concatenates the current index and the next index to a new index.
"c" copies the current pattern to a new index, and sets the current index to
    the new index.
"p" pastes the copied indices and moves the cursor down.
"P" pastes the copied indices.
"y" copies the current index.
"d"/"x"/"Backspace" copies then clears the current index.

PLAYBACK
========
Rows are interpreted from the top down while the sequencer is running. F5
starts the sequencer and F6 stops it. Pressing F6 again while the sequencer is
stopped returns the cursor to the home position (pulls it to the top).
