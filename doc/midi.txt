MIDI
----
omelette can output midi data for external control, on a per-instrument basis.
Each instrument has control over it's midi channel, and if it should write midi
events.

FEATURES
--------
* note on/off events, fine timing (Dxy, dxx, Cxy)
* Mxx, Pxx, Vxy (limited to +/-2 semitones)
  pitch wheel events are sent every ~100 samples, one of the few samplerate
  dependant things.
* gxy acts like Gxy, only Gx is listened to and Gx doesn't apply retroactively
