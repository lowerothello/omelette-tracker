EFFECT REFERENCE
----------------
All the macros that are supported by omelette, and their semantics. Some macros
are heavily inspired by other trackers, some are wholly original.
- All arguments are in hexadecimal (base 16).
- Case is inverted, to input a lowercase macro hold shift.


%xx - NOTE CHANCE
	chance the row will be processed

Bxx - BPM
	set the bpm of the song to xx, values are clamped between 32 and 255
	(xx == 0) sets the bpm back to the starting bpm

Cxy - NOTE CUT
	send a note off x/y through the row

Dxy - NOTE DELAY
	only has any effect if a note is specified
	wait until x/y through the row to trigger the note

dxx - FINE NOTE DELAY
	only has any effect if a note is specified
	wait until xx/256 through the row to trigger the note

Fxx - FILTER CUTOFF
	set the filter cutoff to xx immediately

fxx - SMOOTH FILTER CUTOFF
	interpolate the filter cutoff to xx over the row

Gxy - STEREO GAIN
	set the gain of the left channel to x/15 immediately
	set the gain of the right channel to y/15 immediately
	each trigger implies a G88 call

gxy - SMOOTH STEREO GAIN
	interpolate the gain of the left channel to x/15 over the row
	interpolate the gain of the right channel to y/15 over the row
	each trigger implies a G88 call

Mxx - MICROTONAL OFFSET
	set the microtonal offset to xx/1 semitones
	each trigger implies an M00 call

Oxx - NOTE OFFSET
	set the playhead to xx/256 through the sound

oxx - BACKWARDS NOTE OFFSET
	toggles the reverse bit (walks the pointer backwards)
	(xx > 0) also sets the playhead to xx/256 through the sound
	(xx = 0) just toggles the reverse bit

Pxx - PITCH SLIDE
	portamento to the note specified at speed xx
	low xx values are slower

Rxy - BLOCK RETRIGGER
	retrigger y times each row for x+1 rows
	overridden by another Rxy macro if the block hasn't finished
	will skip forwards to where the pointer should be at the end of the block

txy - GATE
	gates the signal aggressively, more of an effect than a noise gate
	x is the strength of the effect (max reduction and speed)
	y is the threshold
	t?0 to disable

Vxy - VIBRATO
	modulate the pitch of the sample at speed x and depth y
	lfo is hardcoded to a triangle wave
	modulation goes both up and down
	behaves a bit differently to other trackers
	will read another Vxy macro only if the lfo has ended

WAVESHAPERS (Wxy)
	only one waveshaper can be active at a time
	threshold also adds makeup gain, tuned to minimize percieved volume change
W0x - HARD CLIPPER
	clips off the tips of the waveform
	x is the threshold
W1x - SOFT CLIPPER
	rounds off the tips of the signal
	x is the threshold
W2x - RECTIFIER
	rectifies the signal
	full mix will not play the fundamental at all
	x is the mix
W3x - RECTIFIERx2 (shitty octaver)
	rectifies the signal twice
	full mix will not play the fundamental at all
	x is the mix
W4x - WAVEFOLDER
	inverts the tips of the signal
	x is the threshold
W5x - WAVEWRAPPER
	wraps the signal back to 0 when it crosses 1
	x is the threshold
W6x - SIGN CONVERSION
	simulates reading an unsigned number as a signed number
	adds a nasty DC offset, be careful!
	x is the mix

Zxy - FILTER RESONANCE
	y is the filter resonance, set immediately
	x is the filter mode
		0 (default) - low pass (12dB/oct)
		1           - high pass (12dB/oct)
		2           - band pass (12dB/oct)
		3           - band reject (12dB/oct)
Zxy - SMOOTH FILTER RESONANCE
	y is the filter resonance, interpolated over the row
	x is the filter mode
		0 (default) - low pass (12dB/oct)
		1           - high pass (12dB/oct)
		2           - band pass (12dB/oct)
		3           - band reject (12dB/oct)
