	^ test retrigger blocks
-> tracker
	^ visual delete misses the bottom row of the selection
	^ channel delete can fail to yank, not sure why
-> instruments
	^ test retaining relative instrument params after processing

some eq10q mono plugins segfault on load, not sure why



MACROS:
Bxx: set bpm to xx
Cxy: send a note cut at x/y through the row
Dxy: start the note at x/y through the row
Pxx: portamento to target
	xx is the portamento speed
	the note field sets the target
Mxy: channel multiplier
	x is the volume for the left channel
	y is the volume for the right channel
Rxy: s&h retrigger
	x is the number of rows the block continues to
	y is the number of slices in the block
	(y < 2) does nothing
	->	will ratchet the current point in the sample
		and continue as if nothing happened after the block
Oxx: offset
	start the triggered sample at xx 255ths through
Exy: effect mix
	x is the effect index to target
	y is the new mix (
		0 - off (instance disabled)
		1234567 - dry:      100%
				  wet:   0%-100%
		8 - dry/wet: 100%
		9abcdef - dry: 100%-  0%
				  wet:      100%
	)
	the inst field sets the target
	mix will revert to default once the row is over




Effect redesign:
* use custom effects, lv2s are unportable
* should be channelwise, not instrumentwise
* all configuration should be done in the tracker
* changes should persist in channel memory
* last parameter should always control a variant of "mix", 0 being completely off
* channel effect ideas:
	- band pass       bxy {MEMFLTR} x: centre      y: width (0: wide, f: narrow)
	- chorus          cxy {MEMTIME} x: lfo freq    y: gain
	- comb / flanger  fxy {MEMTIME} x: mix         y: [0-7]: fixed time  [8-f]: lfo speed
	- gate            gxy           x: speed       y: threshold
	- high pass       hxy {MEMFLTR} x: resonance   y: cutoff (0: lowest, f: highest)
	- low pass        lxy {MEMFLTR} x: resonance   y: cutoff (0: highest, f: lowest)
	- ring mod        mxy {MEMTIME} x: rate        y: mix
	- phaser (8pole)  pxy {MEMTIME} x: rate        y: mix
	- reverb          rxy           x: tail        y: [0]: clear buffer  [1-f]: input mix
	- saturation      sxy           x: input gain  y: mix
	- wavefolder      vxy           x: input gain  y: mix
	- waveloss        wxy           x: grain size  y: percent to drop
* mastering effect ideas:
	- compressor
	- limiter
	- parametric eq
