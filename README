omelette tracker
----------------

omelette is a modern tracker for the terminal. it should compile and run on any
POSIX compilant system, but i've only tested it on linux.


features aren't set in stone, expect mods to be broken on new versions!
from version 1.0 i'll try not to make as many breaking changes, but until then
treat this as alpha software!

doc/ has some documentation but it's very unfinished and not kept up to date
very well, the only up-to-date source of info is the source code itself rn.
